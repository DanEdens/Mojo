Model:
- On creation, needs to:
    - re-create all attributes as objects of type base_type
    - keep a dict of _data, keyed as follows:
        {attr_name: attr_field_class_deep_copy}
    - On value access of model attribute:
        - Returns base type (so all methods exposed)
    - On assignment:
        - Ovverride just as it does now, assigning value to:
            1. field_class (for validation)
            2. real attribute (for regular access)
    - On Save:
        - Validate model field types
